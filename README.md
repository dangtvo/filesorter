Sick of waiting for Windows trying to load a directory with LOTS of files/children within it? Certain  'homework' directories  you have been stashing over the years are giving you the blue when opening it up to review them?

You may need this little script! It will be going through children within a directory of your choice  and do the following things: 
 
* Check the created time of each child.
* Create the 'Month Year' directories within a new directory called 'sorted'.
* Move the items into the appropriate directory.

On windows, run it as follows:

```
python month.py 'C:\Music\Youtube'
```

Have fun organising large directory!
